# Go Share

## About

Go Share is a simple real-time file-sharing application built in `go`

Often times, I had to share files from my local to drive, which I have to manually delete later, to my ipad, etc.

Sometimes, I even have to share files to someone via whatsapp / drive.

All these are good solutions, but they were never intended for sharing on the run, but mostly on long-term storage and more control on how you access these files.

Go-Share let's you create rooms with people, allow texts in real-time and share files in real-time.

## Tech
